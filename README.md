# KKSA-Ku Privacy Policy Pages

This repository contains a simple privacy policy page for the KKSA-Ku Android app.

Before publishing, replace the contact email in index.html with your real contact email.

## Publish steps (quick):
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `kksa-privacy-policy`).
2. Upload or push the files from this folder.
3. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from branch `main` and root `/` (or use `/docs`).
4. After a few minutes, your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Then paste that URL into Google Play Console → App Content → Privacy Policy.
